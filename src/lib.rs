//! This crate provides a clean, ready to use client for [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv), a
//! distributed transactional Key-Value database written in Rust.
//!
//! With this crate you can easily connect to any TiKV deployment, interact with it, and mutate the
//! data it contains.
//!
//! ## Choosing an API
//!
//! This crate offers both [**raw**](raw/index.html) and
//! [**transactional**](transaction/index.html) APIs. You should choose just one for your system.
//!
//! The *consequence* of supporting transactions is increased overhead of coordination with the
//! placement driver for timestamp acquisition. This is approximately 1 RTT.
//!
//! *While it is possible to use both APIs at the same time, doing so is unsafe and unsupported.*
//!
//! Choose the one that suites your needs as described below, then add the import statement to your
//! file where you need to use the library.
//!
//! ### Transactional
//!
//! The [transactional](transaction/index.html) API supports **transactions** via Multi-Version
//! Concurrency Control (MVCC).
//!
//! **Best when you mostly do** complex sets of actions, actions which may require a rollback,
//! operations affecting multiple keys or values, or operations that depend on strong ordering.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use tikv_client::*;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Raw
//!
//! The [raw](raw/index.html) API has **reduced coordination overhead**, but lacks any
//! transactional abilities.
//!
//! **Best when you mostly do** single row changes, and have very limited cross-row (eg. foreign
//! key) requirements. You will not be able to use transactions with this API.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use tikv_client::*;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Connect
//!
//! Regardless of which API you choose, you'll need to connect your client
//! ([raw](raw::Client), [transactional](transaction::Client)).
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use tikv_client::*;
//! # use futures::prelude::*;
//!
//! # futures::executor::block_on(async {
//! // Configure endpoints and optional TLS.
//! let config = Config::new(vec![ // A list of PD endpoints.
//!     "192.168.0.100:2379",
//!     "192.168.0.101:2379",
//! ]).with_security("root.ca", "internal.cert", "internal.key");
//!
//! // Get a transactional client.
//! let client = TransactionClient::new(config).await.unwrap();
//! # });
//! ```
//!
//! At this point, you should seek the documentation in the related API modules.
