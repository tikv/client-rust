/// A [`ColumnFamily`](ColumnFamily) is an optional parameter for [`raw::Client`](Client) requests.

/// TiKV uses RocksDB's `ColumnFamily` support. You can learn more about RocksDB's `ColumnFamily`s [on their wiki](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Column-Families).
///
/// By default in TiKV data is stored in three different `ColumnFamily` values, configurable in the TiKV server's configuration:
///
/// * Default: Where real user data is stored. Set by `[rocksdb.defaultcf]`.
/// * Write: Where MVCC and index related data are stored. Set by `[rocksdb.writecf]`.
/// * Lock: Where lock information is stored. Set by `[rocksdb.lockcf]`.
///
/// Not providing a call a `ColumnFamily` means it will use the default value of `default`.
///
/// The best (and only) way to create a [`ColumnFamily`](ColumnFamily) is via the `From` implementation:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use tikv_client::ColumnFamily;
///
/// let cf = ColumnFamily::from("write");
/// let cf = ColumnFamily::from(String::from("write"));
/// let cf = ColumnFamily::from(&String::from("write"));
/// ```
///
/// **But, you should not need to worry about all this:** Many functions which accept a
/// `ColumnFamily` accept an `Into<ColumnFamily>`, which means all of the above types can be passed
/// directly to those functions.
